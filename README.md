# Introduction To RTL to GDSII Flow
  RTL to GDSII Flow refers to the all the steps involved in converting a logical Register Transfer Level(RTL) Design to a fabrication ready GDSII format. GDSII is a database file format which is an industry standard for data exchange of IC layout artwork.
  The RTL to GSDII flow consists of following steps:
  - RTL Synthesis
  - Static Timing Analysis(STA)

 ## Basic IC Design Terminologies
  During the Physical Designing, one will come across multiple terminologies that are frequently used. Some of them are mentioned below:
  - Package: It is a case that surrounds the circuit material to protect it from physical damage or corrosion and allow mounting of the electrical contacts connecting it to the printed circuit board (PCB). The below snippet shows an IC with 48 pins and Quad Flat No-Leads(QFN) package.
  - Die: A die is a small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated.
